Today, I wanted to install [StandardJS](https://standardjs.com/) in a project and, once again, **[the available documentation is incomplete](/hostile-documentation/) and doesn't provide usable instructions for what I need: making StandardJS format the code on save in VSCode**. üò°

After going over a previous project, these are the steps that worked for me. _(Thanks to whoever told me how to make it work on a stream! I think the instructions were taken from a video by Miguel √Ångel Dur√°n @midudev)_

## Install StandardJS in your project

```bash
pnpm install standard --save-dev
```

## If not installed, install the StandardJS plugin for VSCode

The [StandardJS plugin for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=standard.vscode-standard) shows alerts editing.

## Configure `package.json`

For StandardJS to format the file on save, we need to add this declaration in the `package.json` file of the project:

```json filename="package.json"
{
  // previous settings ...
  "standard": {
    "format": true
  }
}
```

// previous settings ...
"eslintConfig": {
"extends": "./node_modules/standard/eslintrc.json"
}

````

I have no idea why this specific configuration needs to be referenced this way, but this works.

## How to run StandardJS manually on project files

To process all the files in the project, we can run this command from the terminal:

```bash
npx standard --fix
````

\*\*
**Note:** While StandardJS fixes the format to fit its rules, it can't fix all the errors reported by the linter.

Any errors that can't be fixed, will be reported in the terminal after running the script.

In this example, the linter reports an error: A variable is declared but never used.

```bash
npx standard --fix

standard: Use JavaScript Standard Style (https://standardjs.com)
  /Users/[...]/src/pages/index.js:1:10: 'config' is defined but never used. (no-unused-vars)
```

To fix this error, we need to delete the variable `config` in line 1, column 10 of `src/pages/index.js`.
