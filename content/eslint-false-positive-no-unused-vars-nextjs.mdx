## Problem

After installing adding an .eslintrc.json file to a Next.js project that uses ESLint, I started getting false positives from the no-unused-vars rule. This is how I fixed it.

The error I was getting looked like this:

![ESLint error](images/articles/eslint-false-positive-no-unused-vars-nextjs/01-eslint-false-positive-no-unused-vars.png)

_See the red highlight on all those files? They're all false positives!_
_Like in the `PaginatedArticleList` import, which is clearly used a few lines below._

## Solution

The only thing required to fix this is to add `"next"` to the `extends` in `.eslintrc.json`.

```json filename=".eslintrc.json"
{
  "extends": ["standard", "next"]
}
```
